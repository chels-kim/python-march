# What is a Dictionary?
# - written with curly braces, it is an unordered data structure (unlike a list, which is ordered)
# - it is composed of key-value pairs; values can take on any type of data, but the keys must be "hashable" (not important rn apparently)
# - the components are accessed by keys. In the previous assignment for example, this would allow for flexible modification of the weight categories.
